# BookMark
Java Maven project built for JDBC to interact with SQL as a capstone for Cognixia Future Horizons. This project stores a database of users, trackers and books, and allows users to manage a list of books that they have read, are currently reading, or plan to read. This will allow the user to see their progress with their reading list.
